# Unicorn-obstacle-game

This simple game was made using pygame zero. The player "flies" a unicorn across a "dynamic" landscape using the up/down arrow keys. The objective of the game is to aviod all the obstacles, namely dinosaurs, miners and flying houses.Successfully avioding an obstacle is worth 1 point and the game ends when the unicorn collides with an obstacle.
