# Unicorn-obstacle-game

This simple game was made using pygame zero. The player moves the unicorn across a "moving" landscape using the up/down arrow keys and the objective is to aviod all the obstacles, namely dinosaurs, miners and flying houses.Successfully avioding an obstacle is worth 1 point and the game ends when the unicorn collides with an obstacle.
